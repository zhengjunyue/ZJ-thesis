# Multimodal Acoustic-articulatory Speech Recognition Systems

This chapter demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal acoustic modelling for dysarthric speech recognition using conventional acoustic features along with articulatory information. It extends the previous acoustic-articulatory \ac{ADSR} studies with more recent acoustic modelling architectures. It also discusses how to better apply the articulatory information and what is a better information fusion scheme in an acoustic-articulatory speech recognition system. Section~\ref{sec:emadataprocessing} presents data processing for \ac{EMA} data in TORGO.
