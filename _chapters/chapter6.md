# A Novel Speech Representation Learning Framework

This chapter presents a pilot study of the recent ADSR systems using the TORGO dysarthric database. 

This chapter explores the second research question \textbf{RQ2}: What is a good way to leverage typical speech, which is \ac{OOD}, to learn more robust representations for continuous dysarthric speech?
Motivated by the above previous studies, the work proposes a novel speech representation learning framework for \ac{ACDSR}:  an \ac{AE-BN} feature extractor making use of the \ac{OOD} knowledge with multi-task optimisation techniques.
